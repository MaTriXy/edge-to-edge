# ðŸŒ– Edge-to-Edge 
In meanwhile, here is an Android library for enabling [edge-to-edge content](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/gesturenav) and insetting views using simple Kotlin DSL.

# Getting Started
1. Configure transparent colors of the status and navigation bars in `res/values/styles.xml` by extending a theme without the action bar like `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar` or `Theme.Design.Light.NoActionBar` or similar.

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar">
        ...
        <item name="android:windowDrawsSystemBarBackgrounds">true</item>
        <item name="android:windowTranslucentStatus">false</item>
        <item name="android:windowTranslucentNavigation">false</item>
        <item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/statusBar</item>
        <item name="android:navigationBarColor">@color/navigationBar</item>
    </style>
    
    <color name="statusBar">@android:color/transparent</color>
    <color name="navigationBar">@android:color/transparent</color>
</resources>
```
> Note that fully transparent navigation bar can cause contrast issues to the navigation icons for API level `[23..29)`. Refer to the [Navigation Bar Transparency](https://github.com/beworker/edge-to-edge/wiki/Navigation-Bar-Transparency) wiki page for more details.


2. Remove `android:fitSystemWindows` attribute everywhere from layouts, if present.
3. Fit top and bottom views of each fragment or activity as needed.

```kotlin
override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
    edgeToEdge {
        appbar.fit { Edge.Left + Edge.Top + Edge.Right }
        recycler.fit { Edge.Bottom }
    }
    ...
}
```

See sample app for more edge-to-edge examples.

# Download
```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'de.halfbit:edge-to-edge:<version>'
}
```

# How
The library is implemented around [WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets) class. Each time `WindowInsets` are dispatched through out the view hierarchy, the library fits views according to the declared fitting rules.

Edge-to-Edge library fits each view to one or more device edges by modifying its `padding`, `margin` or `height` attribute with  the values taken from the current `WindowInsets`. Padding and margin attributes preserve their original values defined in layout and inset values are added to them. The library "auto-detects" the attrbitute to modify, which can be overridden by using `fitPadding`, `fitMargin` or `fitHeight` convenience functions.

# Features
* Easiness of use - padding, margin or height can be adjusted to any edge with a single line of code.
* Convenient default parameters for common elements like recycler view, scroll view, floating actions button etc.
* Ability to remove fitting rules, which comes handy when working with transitions in `ConstraintLayout`.
* Demo app with edge-to-edge examples (any kind of contribution is welcome).
